# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.

> > pwd - print working directory
    mkdir - make a new directory ie folder
    exit - exit the shell
    cd - change directory to folder within your current location 
    ls - list folders inside of current folder
    cd /folder/folder - moves you into folders within your current folders
    cd ../ - moves your path one folder ahead
    rmdir - removes a directory given that you are one path above the one you are trying to remove
    pushd - allows you to set a path in memory so that you can return any portion of it later without following a linear fashion
    popd - allows you to move back to your xx original position before your last pushd no matter how far away your cd is from there
    touch filenamehere - allows you to create an empty file in whichever directory you are currently in
    cp file1 file2 - makes a copy of file1, named file2 
    cp file1 /directory1 - makes a copy of a file in a different specified directory
    cp -r folder1 folder 2 - NOT SURE WHAT THIS DOES AS OF CURRENT. I think it copies your most recently created file from             given folder1 into folder2.
    mv oldname newname - move or rather renames file from oldname to newname
    less filename - allows you to see the contents of a file within terminal window. 
            pressing q allows you to quit out of this view.
    
    *ctrl-c clears/abandons your current line of code..
    *need to figure out how to grant myself permission to copy a file into an already existing folder(ex21)
