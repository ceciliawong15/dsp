# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.

> > pwd - print working directory (whole path)
    mkdir - make a new directory ie folder
    exit - exit the shell
    cd - change directory to folder within your current location 
    ls - list folders inside of current folder
    pwd - print working directory
    cd /folder/folder - moves you into folders within your current folders
    cd ../ - moves your path one folder up (in this case)
